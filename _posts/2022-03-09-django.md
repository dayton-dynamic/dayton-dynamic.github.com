# March topic: Django web development

Get introduced to Django, a Python platform for building dynamic websites.

All dynamic languages offer a variety of ways to run a webserver for dynamic websites.
Django is the most popular Python-based example of the genre, and also a good example
of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern that most dynamic web platforms follow.  
Created at the Lawrence Journal-World in Kansas, its attention to good documentation 
helped it take off.  

# Location reminder 

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
