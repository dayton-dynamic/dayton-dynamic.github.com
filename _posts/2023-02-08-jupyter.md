# February topic: Jupyter 

Jupyter is a tool that combines code execution with 
sophisticated presentation in environments like web 
browsers.  It's usually seen among Python developers 
but can be used with most languages.  We've introduced 
it before and used it in many meetings to demonstrate 
code, but we've barely scratched the surface.  
A huge array tools and extensions have been built 
around Jupyter to grow it into an ecosystem whose size 
lives up to its name.  In fact, there's an entire
[annual conference](https://www.jupytercon.com)
dedicated to the Jupyter ecosystem!  So let's 
[probe more deeply](https://www.planetary.org/space-missions/every-jupiter-mission)  
into this massive object of the Software System.

Happy Valentines' Day!

- Design principle of the month

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
