# Topic: Make It Dayton prep 

The [Make It Dayton festival](http://www.makeitdayton.org/make-it-dayton-festival/) is coming up Oct. 5, and we're 
getting some projects ready to show off:

- A NodeBot 
- The great kinetically-controlled Flappy Birds
- Some video game hacking 

Come take a look, contribute some ideas, maybe get some more 
ideas to add to our table.

See you there, 7 PM at Brixx!
