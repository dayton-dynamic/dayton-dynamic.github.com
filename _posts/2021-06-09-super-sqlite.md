# In-person AND Online Meeting!

For the first time in more than a year, DDL is meeting *in person*!  
If you've been fully vaccinated, come down to 
[Brixx](https://www.brixxicecompany.com/) and fill your 
stomach and your brain, and see your DDL friends in the flesh at 
last. 

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've converted yourself to purely digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.


# Topic: Super SQLite 

*SQLite?  More like SQLMight!  Amirite?"

SQLite is a database technology usable from virtually every programming 
language.  It runs without a server process; a SQLite database is simply 
a file.  It's almost literally omnipresent... for instance, it's lurking 
on your cell phone as we speak.

I've long thought of SQLite like a Fisher-Price database: very easy, 
but not really a serious database.  It turns out that I was only right 
about the "very easy" part.  SQLite can serve up large quantities of data 
very quickly and support powerful applications as well as basic ones.

And there's been a flowering of great tools, like sqlite-utils,  dogsheep, 
and Datasette, that make it easy to pull data into SQLite, munge and
manipulate it, and explore it with beautiful visualizations, all without 
becoming a big database geek.  

So let's have some serious fun with this not-a-toy-after-all database.

As usual, bring your grab bag of questions, thoughts, news, and 
projects in or about any language to throw in the soup.  We always have a good discussion.
