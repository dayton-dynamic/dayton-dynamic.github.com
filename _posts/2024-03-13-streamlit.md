# March 2024: Streamlit data apps 

If you'd like to make a good-looking, modern data data-based 
application, you'll need to learn HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and 
a backend server language.  Ugh, that sounds hard.

So let's not!  Let's try [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) instead.  It's a Python package 
that makes data web apps addictively easy to build with just a few lines of Python; you can skip practically all the hard work of building web front-ends. 

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
