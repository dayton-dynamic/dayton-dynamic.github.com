# Special Event

On August 11, the Victoria 
Theater is screening 
[Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://victoriatheatre.com/shows/monty-python/).
The show is at 10:30 PM; beginning at 9:30 PM, we'll have 
a table in the lobby to show people Python, the language 
named after Monty Python.  We'll have some homemade 
Monty-Python based games, and even prizes to give away!

Come whenever you can (even if it's just for the show) and 
stack layers of geekery one atop another.
