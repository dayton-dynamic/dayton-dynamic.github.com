# March 2025: PyIodide 

Special presenter: [Dr. Aaron Nielsen](https://www.afit.edu/bios/bio.cfm?facID=818)!

[PyIodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) a port of CPython to WebAssembly/Emscripten).
That means real-live Python that can run inside a browser!

DDL has investigated several PyIodide-based technologies in past 
meetings - PyScript, jupyterlite, and Datasette Lite - but we've 
never yet had a chance to focus on the PyIodide infrastructure that 
drives them all, and we've never before had a chance to hear from someone 
who has used PyIodide in a real project.  Dr. Nielsen will demonstrate 
his work integrating PyIodide with Quatro - generating a website and 
presentation slides with executable Python right inside them!

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
