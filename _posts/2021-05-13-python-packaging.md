## Topic: Proper Python Packaging 

There is absolutely no shame in slapping together a one-file script and running it with 
`python myscript.py`.  Often that's exactly the right thing to do.

But sometimes you want to package up code in a way that makes it easy to include in other 
code - yours or other people's.  That's what Python packages are for, and writing a professional-grade 
package includes addressing several aspects like testing, documentation, dependency specification, 
and publishing.  The state of the art in Python packaging keeps evolving, and consensus is finally 
settling toward a common set of best practices.  Even if you don't use them all, getting a look at 
them will help you write more solid and reusable code.

As usual, bring your grab bag of questions, thoughts, news, and 
projects in or about any language to throw in the soup.  We always have a good discussion.
