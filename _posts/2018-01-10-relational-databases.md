Last month's broad survey of database technologies notwithstanding,
relational databases really are often the best tool for the job.
But the chances are you could be using them better if you knew 
them, and that SQL that they understand, a little better.  What 
are the most useful aspects of relational databases for a general 
programmer to understand?

As always, we'll take some time for your general thoughts, questions, and ideas.
See you there!
