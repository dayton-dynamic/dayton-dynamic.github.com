# June topic: freeform discussion

(Or, _When the Cat(herine)'s Away..._)

June is dedicated to *freeform discussion*.  Bring your thoughts, 
ideas, things you've heard about that intrigue you, and explore 
them together with your DDL friends.  DDL is famous for fitting 
in a ton of freeform discussion even when there is an announced
topic, so this time we'll go all-in.

Meanwhile, Catherine is in Colombia, doing a dry run of her next 
DDL presentation by delivering it as a keynote to PyCon Colombia.

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
