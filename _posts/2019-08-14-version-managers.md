# Topic: Version managers

Whether it's Python, Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, or something else, the 
latest version of your favorite programming language has some great
new features that are fun to play with.  On the other hand, you don't
necessarily want to live on the bleeding edge on your important work 
projects.  And then there's that old utility you need that depends on 
an ancient, clunky old version from five years back.

So how can you get a bunch of different language versions installed on 
your machine and keep straight which one goes with each project?  Well,
that's what version managers like RVM, Pyenv, perlbrew, and nvm are 
for.  Once you've learned to use them, you'll be able to confidently 
use a bunch of versions of your favorite language, including the wild
ones you've never dared before.  PyPy, anyone?

We'll also recap the news from PyOhio!

7 PM at Brixx Ice House.  See you then!
