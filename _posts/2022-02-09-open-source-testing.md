# February topic: Testing OpenOffice

Carl Marcum, our resident OpenOffice contributor, is going to lead discussion on 
testing in open-source projects with a review of his FOSDEM 2022 talk.  Testing 
a project as big and imporant as OpenOffice is a bigger testing challenge than 
most of us will ever take on, but learning about how it's done in the major leagues 
can help inform our own modest testing efforts.

Catherine will round out the evening with some useful tools from the Python world, and 
as usual, we'll all benefit from some cool discussion.

# Location reminder 

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
