# Topic: Non-Stupid SQL Tricks 

If you handle data, sooner or later you'll need to use a relational 
database, which means using SQL.  Some love SQL and some hate it, 
but when you learn a little more about how to use it effectively, we 
might be able to push you more toward the SQL side.

Note that we're talking about the SQL `language`, a language specialized 
for getting data into and out of databases.  The term is sometimes 
confused with Microsoft SQL Server, which is one of many databases 
you can use with SQL.
