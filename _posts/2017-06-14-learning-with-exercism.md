The world is full of programming languages and online tutorials to learn them,
but [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) just might be the most intriguing.  
It works your skills up
through iterative, test-driven development with lots of feedback.  And it's 
available for over 30 languages, from the industry standbys to the wacky 
experimental ones.  We'll go through getting set up with Elixir and starting
out with it.  Just to make things interesting, we'll pick a language at random 
none of us knows.

We'll review some other favorite software-learning tools while we're at it.

As always, we take time for discussion and questions around any dynamic language: Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Javascript... whatever's on your mind!
