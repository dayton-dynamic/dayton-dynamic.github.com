# POSTPONED.  Curse you COVID-19

## Topic: Programming for kids: [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and blocks 

How can you corrupt the youth in your life to our 
dissolute programming lifestyle?  Try a block-based
programming environment, like Scratch.  The drag- 
and-drop interface is far less intimidating 
than a page of text, yet it incorporates all the same 
principles of programming, creating an easy on-ramp 
toward amateur or even professional programming.  

We'll mostly cover Scratch, the best-known block 
programming system based on Scheme, but also touch on 
systems based on JavaScript, Python, etc.
You'll leave prepared to indoctrinate your kids, 
niece/phews, godchildren, neighbors' kids, girl scouts 
selling cookies, etc.
