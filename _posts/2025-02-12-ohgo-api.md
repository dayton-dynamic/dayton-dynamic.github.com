# February 2025: ODOT API & maps

ODOT provides an API to provide raw data on traffic and road
conditions at [OHGO](https://ohgo.com/).  It's a good simple 
example to get familiar with Python scripts to fetch and present 
API data.  We can 

- Pull data from the API
- Display it as a Pandas dataframe
- Display it in web maps using `folium` 

Also, [Dayton TechFest](https://www.techfestdayton.org/) is coming up 
the following weekend,
February 15-16, and DDL is joining with 
[DLUG](https://linux.dma1.org/about-dlug/)
to present some cool open-source fun to the youth of Dayton.  
We've prepared a webcam-munging project,  
[Photo-Jumblee](https://github.com/dayton-dynamic/photo-jumblee/),
that we can review and tweak.

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
