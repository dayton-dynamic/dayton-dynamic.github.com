# December topic: match-case / Structural Pattern Matching in Python and Ruby

In the beginning was C's `switch` statement, which allowed 
choosing between multiple options, but was never adopted by 
dynamic languages because it didn't really do anything that 
a series of `if` statements couldn't do.

But then came match-case statements, or Structural Pattern Matching,
made popular in languages like Rust and Scala.  At first glimpse 
they look like C's `switch`, but they actually have a lot more 
subtle power.  

Ruby's 
[version 2.7](https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#pattern-matching) (from 2019) and Python's newest 
[release, 3.10](https://realpython.com/python310-new-features/), both 
have implementions of Structural Pattern Matching.  It's pretty cutting-edge 
in both cases, so you can be the first kid on your block to put these 
interesting features to use.  Your Mom will be so proud!

We'll also discussed what we learned at Ohio LinuxFest!

# Location reminder 

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
