# July 2025: Profiling Python programs / uv, simplified 

Double-header for July!

## Profiling Python programs 

If your Python program runs slowly and/or is using too much memory, don't just go haring off 
trying to optimize it based on eyeballing the code and taking a guess.  There is a variety of 
tools available to help you zero in on which portions of your program are the bottleneck, and 
that's the first and most important step of fixing your speed problems.  We'll try out 
py-spy and memray.

**and** 

## uv (simplified)

We had an introduction to uv last year - the package and Python installer that's conquering 
the Python world, but it was a lot to take in.  In case it went by 
in a blur, we're going to do a re-introduction that's intentionally slimmed-down and 
slower.  (But we'll also add in a few terribly nice new features, too.)

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We're back in person!

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
