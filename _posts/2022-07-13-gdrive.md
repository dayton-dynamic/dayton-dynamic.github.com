# July topic: Taming Google Drive with Python

Cloud storage providers generally offer an ample amount 
of storage space to individual users for free.  Well, it's
ample until you run out.  And, using the provided web 
interface, it can be surprisingly tricky 
to get a handle on what all is actually in there - what is 
hogging the space.

Catherine is facing the choice of paying $2/month for more 
storage, or taking on a new Python project to understand and 
manage her Google Drive.  Is that even a choice?  So she'll
take you through her project.  The star of the show is 
[PyDrive](https://pypi.org/project/PyDrive/), 
but the work also features [jsonlines](https://jsonlines.org/), 
[cmd2](https://pypi.org/project/cmd2/), 
and some general Python goodness.


## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
