# JSON Juggling

JSON has become software's lingua franca, the most common way for programs to 
serialize data for sharing between programs, between languages, and between 
machines.  We'll try out some "small sharp tools" that help you handle JSON
efficiently: `jq` and `gron`.

As a data source, we'll do a little civic hacking on [FACE Ohio](https://faceohio.sos.state.oh.us),
the state's campaign finance data open data tool.

And, as always, bring your miscellaneous questions, ideas, and projects to 
talk about!

Wed, April 11 in the Dayton Chess Club.
