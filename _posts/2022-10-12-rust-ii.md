# October topic: Rust (Part II)

In October Jim Carr will lead us onward in learning the 
Rust programming language.  

If you couldn't make September, please [look through 
Jim's Rust Language Examples](https://jfcarr.github.io/rust-tech-talk/) 
sections 1-3 (up through the end of Flow Control) to catch up.
If you *were* there in September, it may be a good idea to 
review anyway before we start in October.

Rust combines C-like speed with beautiful modern language 
design and ironclad memory safety.  It's often rated as the 
most beloved language in developers' surveys, and is 
being used in an increasing number of 
[applications](https://www.dunebook.com/amazing-rust-opensource-projects/).

(Yes, I know Rust is not a dynamic language.  We are willing
to commit minor heresy here on occasion.  Besides, it's a
*cool* language, which is the important part.)

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
