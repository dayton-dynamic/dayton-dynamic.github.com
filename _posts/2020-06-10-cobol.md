## Topic: COBOL 

"Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history." - Abraham Lincoln

COBOL has, unexpectedly, been 
[in the news](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/20/brush-up-your-cobol-why-is-a-60-year-old-language-suddenly-in-demand/) 
 again.  Let's take a 
look at it!  Maybe we'll appreciate our up-to-date languages 
more by really thinking about they ways they do - and don't - 
contrast with ancient ones.  

No need to bring a teletype and paper tape.
We'll figure out a way to run COBOL on our machines.
