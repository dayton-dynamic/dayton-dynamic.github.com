# Online Meeting 

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.

## Topic: Gamewriting clinic 

Let's make a game!  Let's make it from scratch!  And from Scratch!

We'll focus on Scratch, since it's an easy-to-use but powerful language 
that you can write and run within your web browser without setting up 
a single thing on your computer.  But we'll also do a quick survey of 
some other interesting options, like

- Game-building libraries: PyGame, PPB, Arcade, Gosu, kiwi.js, ... 
- Game engines: Alice, Ren'Py, Urho3D

As usual, bring your grab bag of questions, thoughts, news, and 
projects in or about any language to throw in the soup.  We always have a good discussion.
