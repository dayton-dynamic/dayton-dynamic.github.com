# August topic: Packaging and Poetry 

Matt Alioto has been diving deep into Poetry, and 
will lead discussion on how packages define their 
dependencies, and why we should care.

We'll put particular focus on packaging in Python - the 
problems that Python's older packaging systems have led 
to, and the improvements that 
[pyproject.toml](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/)-based 
tools like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) bring.

August topic: Packaging and Poetry

Matt Alioto has been diving deep into Poetry, and will lead discussion on how packages define their dependencies, and why we should care.

We’ll put particular focus on packaging in Python - the problems that Python’s older packaging systems have led to, and the improvements that pyproject.toml-based tools like Poetry bring.

This month, we're also going to premier a new meeting feature: the Design Topic of the Month.  Each month, we'll describe a design principle that other programmers have proposed to help guide good program design, and spend a few minutes discussing it.  For August, we'll discuss Chesterton's Fence.

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
