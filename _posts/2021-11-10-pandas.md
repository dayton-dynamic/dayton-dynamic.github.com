# Workshop: Processing Large Data with Pandas

Pandas has become an incredibly popular Python package for 
processing data.  We've had brief mentions of it before, but 
this month we have a proper workshop by a subject matter 
expert, Dayton's own Evelyn Boettcher!


In this tutorial, we will:

-    Learn how Python uses memory with Pandas
-    How to reduce the Pandas' dataframe memory footprint.
-    Learn what data types are
-    Speed up reading in csv files by using categories
-    Reduce the memory footprint by 90%

This is a hands-on workshop - bring a laptop if you can!

# New meeting location!

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've converted yourself to purely digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
