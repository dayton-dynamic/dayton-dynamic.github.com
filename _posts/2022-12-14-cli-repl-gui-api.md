# December topic: CLIs, REPLs, GUIs, APIs, webapps 

... and how to tell the difference!

Programs generally have a core of functionality - 
a calculation they can make, information they can 
process or look up, etc.  And then they need ways
for a user to actually invoke that functionality.
It does no good to develop the best "Hello World" 
program 

Programmers have developed a death-by-acronym set of 
terms describing various means to get at that 
functionality.

We'll take a lightning tour of what all these are, 
an example of how to build one in Python, and 
techniques for providing multiple ways to access a 
single core program. 

## Also featuring 

- Design principle of the month

- Why I can't present on [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev) (yet?) 

- Post-[OLF](https://olfconference.org) discussion 

- PyDay (oops, forgot to discuss in November)

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
