# Topic: Grab bag 

Dayton Dynamic Languages is truly *dynamic*, and we always have a lot of enlightening 
discussion with or without a planned topic.  Well, for August we're going to exercise 
that and have unplanned discussion.

As usual, bring your grab bag of questions, thoughts, news, and 
projects in or about any language to throw in the soup.  We always have a good discussion.



# In-person AND Online Meeting!

If you've been fully vaccinated, come down to 
[Brixx](https://www.brixxicecompany.com/) and fill your 
stomach and your brain, and see your DDL friends in the flesh at 
last. 

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've converted yourself to purely digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
