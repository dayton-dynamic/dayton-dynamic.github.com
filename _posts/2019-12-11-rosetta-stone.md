# Topic: Building a Rosetta Stone

For December, let's put together a Christmas present... a 
Programmers' Rosetta Stone for comparing how to do tasks 
across different programming languages

The current (very early) version of the project lives at 
http://d8ndl.org/rowsetta-stone/build/

We can work together on growing and filling in the matrix, 
brainstorming what sort of tasks to include and sharing 
(or looking up) how to implement them in all our favorite 
languages.  Or our least favorite languages.  Or just the 
weird ones.

Other possible discussion topics, depending on our mood:

- Latest version of the Holy Grail: Run Away game 
- Who's doing Advent of Code? 

See you on Wednesday at Brixx!
