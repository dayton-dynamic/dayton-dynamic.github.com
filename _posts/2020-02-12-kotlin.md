# Topic: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)

Kotlin is modern open-source language for the JVM that takes 
ideas and inspiration from many of the dynamic languages 
we love (though it's not actually a dynamic language itself).
It's multi-purpose, but especially popular for development 
of Android apps.  We'll take a look - you may fall in love, 
or just get some good ideas!
