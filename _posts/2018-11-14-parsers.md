# Topic: Parsers

Marc Abel presents Parsers!

As you read this sentence, your mind identifies the words, punctuation,
and the boundaries of the sentence.  Good job - your internal parser is 
working well.

To write your own languages, you'll need a parser - whether it's a full-fledged 
Turing complete language, or just a tiny special-purpose Domain Specific Language 
(DSL).  Even if you don't, insight into how code is parsed helps you know and 
love your programming language better.
