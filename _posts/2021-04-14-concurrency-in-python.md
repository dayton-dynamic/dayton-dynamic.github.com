# Online Meeting 

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.

## Topic: Concurrency in Python 

Fast programs often call for doing more than one thing at a time.  Threading, multiprocessing, and async are 
three of the strategies used to do it.

Stephen Hinton will be leading us in discussion comparing the pros and cons of the threading, multiprocessing, 
and asyncio libraries in python.  Specifically, we'll look at what workloads are best for each library, 
and an overview of a few python libraries that can be used in asyncio event loops. 

As usual, bring your grab bag of questions, thoughts, news, and 
projects in or about any language to throw in the soup.  We always have a good discussion.
