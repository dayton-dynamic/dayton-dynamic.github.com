# Topic: Rust 

Rust is a new programming langugage rapidly gaining popularity.  It's
 a multi-paradigm systems programming language focused on safety, 
especially safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++,
 but is designed to provide better memory safety while maintaining 
high performance. 

So... let's get a peek and see what we think!  Whether or not you ever 
program in Rust, getting a look into it will 
widen your horizons and help you think about programming more 
creatively.  

Rust is not actually a dynamic language, but obeying Grace Hopper's
principle of 
EAFP (Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission), we're going to 
get introduced to it anyway!
