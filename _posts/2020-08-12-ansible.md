# Online Meeting 

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.


## Topic: Ansible 

Ansible is a Python-based technology for remote systems administration that lets you manage all sorts of systems from servers to Raspberry Pis from the comfort of your favorite machine.  How does it work?

*Magic!*

... er, wait, not magic.  Actually, we're going to dig into some details of how it works and see 
what we can learn.  Stephen Hinton led the Dayton Linux Group through a look at Ansible last month, 
and now he'll be our guide as we do what our group does best: tear into the guts of a technology 
together and poke at its odd corners.  We're all about curiosity!

We'll also review interesting stuff we've come across this summer at PyOhio and elsewhere.  Bring 
your questions and your thoughts!
