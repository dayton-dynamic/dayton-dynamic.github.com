# September topic: Rust 

Rust combines C-like speed with beautiful modern language 
design and ironclad memory safety.  It's often rated as the 
most beloved language in developers' surveys, and is 
being used in an increasing number of 
[applications](https://www.dunebook.com/amazing-rust-opensource-projects/).

We've looked at Rust in 2019, but this time we have a 
genuine Rustacean to guide our way: Jim Carr!  
And techniques for tying Rust into programs written in 
languages [like Python](https://github.com/PyO3)
have continued to develop, so you can easily write hybrid 
applications that use each language where it's easiest.

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
