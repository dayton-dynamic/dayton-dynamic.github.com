# Topic: Lua 

Every new language you learn (even a little) stretches your brain.
Prepare yourself!

Lua is a lightweignt scripting language designed primarily for 
embedded use in applications.  It's got a lot in common with our
better-known dynamic languages like Perl, Python, and Ruby.  You 
may already own apps, games, or microprocessors you could script 
with Lua.  Let's give it a spin!

Come enjoy dinner in our new meeting place upstairs at 
Brixx Ice Co., meet inquisitive fellow programmers 
(novice and veteran), have fun, and learn some great stuff.
