## Topic: Object-Oriented Master Class

Every time you think you understand object-oriented programming, 
somebody drops yet another wacky OO jargon term.  What does it 
all mean?  How can you possibly catch up?  Well, by doing a deep 
dive with your friends from DDL, that's how.

Let's talk about... 

- Instantiating
- Constructors
- Class and instance attributes and methods
- Subclasses
- Multiple inheritence
- Method Resolution Order
- Mixins
- Interfaces
- Abstract Base Classes

Sound like jibberish?  Great.  It won't when we're done.  

We'll look at the use of these concepts in Python, in JavaScript... 
and in whatever other language you're interested in (although in 
that case we'll probably need to madly websearch for it.  But that's
what we do best.)

As usual, bring your grab bag of questions, thoughts, news, and 
projects to throw in the soup.  We always have a good discussion.
