You can learn how to program from good programs, but what fun is that?  Let's learn how _not_ to program from bad ones. 

We'll draw on some cool books and websites that give examples of bad programming, but I expect most of you will arrive with your own horror stories.

As always, we'll take some time for your general thoughts, questions, and ideas.
See you there!
