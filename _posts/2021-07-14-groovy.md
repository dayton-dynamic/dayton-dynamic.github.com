# In-person AND Online Meeting!

If you've been fully vaccinated, come down to 
[Brixx](https://www.brixxicecompany.com/) and fill your 
stomach and your brain, and see your DDL friends in the flesh at 
last. 

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've converted yourself to purely digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.


# Topic: Groovy 

There's a popular dynamic language which, in all these years, we'd never yet 
covered: Groovy!  Groovy is a JVM-based language that introduces Java 
developers to the delights of dynamic language programming.  Fortunately, 
we have a local expert!  Carl Marcum has presented on Groovy at multiple 
national conferences, and now he brings his expertise home.

As usual, bring your grab bag of questions, thoughts, news, and 
projects in or about any language to throw in the soup.  We always have a good discussion.
