# Topic: Programming Single-Board Computers 

On September 12, we'll have *three* presenters demoing and 
discussing 
using and programming single-board computers!  The tech world has 
exploded with small, cheap, but amazingly powerful computers 
perfect for interacting with hardware.  Use your dynamic 
language skills in whole new ways... 

- Adafruit [Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express), a single-board computer for 
learning electronics and programming  (Catherine Devlin)

- [WiPy](https://pycom.io/product/wipy-3/), a MicroPython 
enabled WiFi & Bluetooth IoT development platform (Ken Phelps) 

- Raspberry Pi vulnerability surface.  Forewarned is forearmed - 
know what you're getting yourself into before you turn control 
of your robot army over to Vladimir Putin.   (Marc Abel) 

Come enjoy dinner in our new meeting place, upstairs at 
Brixx Ice Co., have fun, and learn some great stuff.
