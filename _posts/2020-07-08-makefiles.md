# Online Meeting 

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.


## Topic: Make files 

There's an old-school technology called Makefiles which you've no doubt noticed on your system,
quietly controlling setup for all sorts of software.  Turns out you can make use of these yourself 
with a little time to learn about them.

This will be a casual Q&A where our Makefile n00bs will grill our resident experts.  We're good at that!
