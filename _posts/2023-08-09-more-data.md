# August topic: More on data 

In July, we attempted a big-picture overview of decisions 
about storing your data... and only got about halfway through.
For August, we'll finish!

Catherine gave a keynote at PyCon Colombia in June - now that's 
she's had a practice run there, she's going to present for DDL.
Unsurprisingly, there will be some focus on Python programmers, 
but most of it should be useful to everybody.

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
