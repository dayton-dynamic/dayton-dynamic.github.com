# December 2024: DuckDB 

The latest technology taking the data engineering world by storm is, 
fortunately, not some brain-bending map-reduce gobbletigook or whatnot.
Nope, it is a delightfully simple technology, inspired by SQLite, but 
with super-fast analytic powers, flexible data sources, and a lovely,
forgiving dialect of PostgreSQL.  And it's named for a duck.


## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
