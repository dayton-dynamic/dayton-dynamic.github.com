# Topic: CircuitPython 

[CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/welcome-to-circuitpython/what-is-circuitpython) is a version of Python designed to simplify 
experimenting and learning to program on low-cost microcontroller 
boards.  There's a new generation of boards designed to make it 
easier than ever to get code interacting with the physical world 
with built-in sensors, input/output pins, and of course blinking 
lights.  We'll bring in a 
[Circuit Playground Express](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/overview) and learn to hack on it.
