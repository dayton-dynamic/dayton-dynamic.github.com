You may think "MySQL" or "PostgreSQL" when you think "database", 
but the truth is that those *relational* databases are only one
class of the huge array of technologies that can be used to 
store and retrieve data.  Each class of database has its own 
benefits, drawbacks, and problems it's best suited for.  We'll
review the most important ones as well as some interesting
variants.

- Key:value stores
- Document databases
- Relational databases
- Graph databases
