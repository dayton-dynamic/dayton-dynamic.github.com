# January topic: htmx 

htmx is a technology for creating dynamic web pages without (directly) using JavaScript.

Usually, building a website with interesting, active functionality means writing JavaScript.
htmx offers an alternative by introducing custom HTML tag attributes that are interpreted 
seamlessly by the htmx JavaScript library to produce the most common kind of effects you might 
otherwise use JavaScript for.  

We'll walk through some examples of building htmx-powered websites.

# Location reminder 

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
