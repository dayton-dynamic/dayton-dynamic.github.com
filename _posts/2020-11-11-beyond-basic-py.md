## Topic: Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python 

Have you ever wanted to feel like a VIP getting special favors?

Pretty much everybody needs to learn Python these days, and there are almost countless 
books and tutorials to get you introduced to it.  Okay, but what next?  How to go from "yes, 
I did the tutorial" to practical use of Python for actual projects - while continuing 
a gentle ramp-up from beginner status?

Al Sweigart is a Python teacher and author rightly famous for (among other things) his book 
[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/).  He's now 
coming out with another book, _Beyond the Basic Stuff With Python_, that's all about 
exactly those next steps.  He draws on his experience with many real learners to bridge that gap between 
"can do Python in theory" and "can do Python in reality".  But it's still only in preorder status!

OK, here's where the special favors part comes in.  I (Catherine) got an advanced copy!  So let's 
crack it open, see what it's got, and answer the questions you know you have and the ones you 
didn't know you had.  Even I learned some stuff!

As usual, bring your grab bag of questions, thoughts, news, and 
projects in or about any language to throw in the soup.  We always have a good discussion.
