# October 2024: Interactive Terminal Plotting 

Our special October presenter is Dr. David Woodburn!

He'll present on 
[Interactive Tutorial Plotting](https://pypi.org/project/itrm/).  
This library introduces powerful tools for visualizing data directly in the terminal, addressing the frustrations developers, engineers, and scientists face when working in environments like SSH. The interactive plotting function, iplot, eliminates the need to switch contexts or transfer files to another machine just to view data. By enabling quick data inspection and interaction within the terminal, it not only speeds up analysis but also enhances understanding, offering a smooth, efficient workflow. Whether working locally or remotely, this tool saves time and effort, making data visualization less tedious and more dynamic.

Dr. Woodburn is also the package author, so we can 
ask him about the experience of creating and maintaining 
an open-source project.

David Woodburn has been teaching at the ANT Center since 2020. He has a Ph.D. in Electromagnetics from UCF, and he has six years of experience working in controls, modeling and simulation, circuit design, generators, and digital signal processing. He is now director of the Distance Learning Program in Guidance Navigation and Control. His research primarily focuses on inertial navigation.

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
