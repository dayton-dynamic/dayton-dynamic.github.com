# June topic: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) 

For June, guest speaker Matthew Alioto will introduce us to FastAPI.

FastAPI is a new-ish web framework for APIs that is growing rapidly 
in popularity.  FastAPI is known for its speed (surprise, surprise) 
and its modern design, taking advantage of several techniques that 
have become popular in the Python community for producing reliable, 
clear code.


## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
