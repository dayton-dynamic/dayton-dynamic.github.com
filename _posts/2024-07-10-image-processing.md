# July 2024: Image processing 

All those Kids These Days spend their time manipulating photos on 
their phones.  Are you going to uselessly yell at them to get 
off your lawn?  Tell them cave pictographs were good enough when 
you were a kid?  No, you're going to outdo them - you're going to 
manipulate photos with code. 

We'll have an introductory play session with Python's 
[Pillow library](https://python-pillow.org/), plus plenty of 
time for our usual general discussion.


## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
