Dave Caraway gave an outstanding presentation on data visualization at the Dayton Data Visualization meetup in February, and he's agreed to bring it to us for March.

Jupyter notebook (formerly Ipython notebook) has become a critical tool for many data scientists and researchers, but when publishing the notebooks to the web, the visualizations become rather bland static images. In this talk, we'll cover a few ways to make your notebooks come alive by building clickable JavaScript visualizations and simple user-interfaces with the Bokeh and Plotly open-source libraries.

As always, we take time for discussion and questions around any dynamic language: Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Javascript... whatever's on your mind!
