# NEW LOCATION  

From now on, instead of the Chess Club, we'll be meeting 
upstairs at [Brixx Ice Company](https://www.brixxicecompany.com/)
in downtown Dayton.  Yum!

# Topic: Monty Python and the Holy Game 

For many of us, 2-D arcade games were our introduction to 
computers.  Let's get back to the good old days and look at 
how to write them!  We'll focus on Python's `arcade` library, 
with a quick look at some options in other languages.

# Upcoming Event: Monty Python and the Holy Game 

The Saturday after our meeting (August 11), the Victoria 
Theater is screening [Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://victoriatheatre.com/shows/monty-python/).
Let's go, show folks the language named after Monty Python 
and the Monty Python trivia game we've written in it, and 
enjoy the show!
