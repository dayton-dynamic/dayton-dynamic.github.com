CRUD stands for Create, Remove, Update, and Delete - the four basic 
operations applied to database objects - and it's often used to 
describe forms used to manipulate a database.  Many web applications
amount to interfaces to let users see and change data this way.

A good web app can be a lot of work, but what if we're lazy?
What's the easiest way we can get a basic webform up that 
interacts with a database?  Let's find out.

As always, we'll take some time for your general thoughts, questions, and ideas.
See you there!
