# PLACE CHANGE!  And PyCon Review

We've got a problem!  The Chess Club won't be available on Wednesdays anymore.  I haven't been able to find downtown alternative locations yet.

Since we're out of time and I don't want to lose people by moving far, let's meet *at spaghetti warehouse at 7*.  We won't be able to project anything, but that should be OK for now.  We'll stick a sign to the Chess Club door so people who miss this message won't have to go far.

Also, we'll discuss the glories of PyCon in Ohio.
