# April 2025: APL Fools' 

⌊∘.+⍨.5×4!⍨⍳5

NSort←{0=⍴⍵:⍬ ⋄ (U/⍵),∇(~U←⍵=⌊/⍵)/⍵}

Where we're going, ASCII can't follow.  We've been threatening it 
for years, but now we're finally going 
to do it - we're going to take on 
[APL](https://xpqz.github.io/learnapl/intro.html).  

For this very special meeting, we've lined up the following 
experienced APL programmer:

*none whatsover* 

No, we'll experiment together in realtime; no notes, no net, 
no insurance, no witnesses.  By the end, surely we'll be ready to 
write production-ready APL code... or, at least, we'll have some 
fun and widen our minds.

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
