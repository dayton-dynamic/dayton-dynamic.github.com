# May topic: [Pyscript](https://pyscript.net/) 

In his April 30 keynote at this year's PyCon, Peter Wang of Anaconda 
set the Python world buzzing.  Running Python in the browser has been 
a Holy Grail for years, but it's finally here - as simple and as 
powerful as anyone had hoped, thanks to WASM.

Now witness the firepower of this fully ARMED and OPERATIONAL 
WASM-based technology.

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
