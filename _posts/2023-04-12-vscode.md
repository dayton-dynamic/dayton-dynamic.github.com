# April topic: VSCode 

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a 
free, cross-platform, open-source,
multi-language 
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with a clean 
interface, a powerful feature set, and an enormous 
ecosystem of available plugins.  No matter how much 
you know about it currently, there's still a huge 
variety of capabilities you're not familiar with.  

Jim Carr will present on VSCode and its support for 
dynamic languages specifically.  

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
