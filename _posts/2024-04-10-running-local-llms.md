# April 2024: Running Local LLMs 

## Crossover meeting with Gem City Machine Learning

For April, we're going to crash Gem City Machine Learning's 
party!  GCML's Nick Gerakines is presenting to GCML:

> Running your own LLM is pretty easy and there are a lot of tools and platforms that make it possible. If you have the right hardware, with a little bit of elbow grease, you can run your own chatbots and interact with LLMs using session interfaces and APIs.

... and we're going to join them!  They're coming to our meeting place 
(The Hub) and our time - well, roughly (social time starts at 6 PM,
lecture at 6:30).  So let's all get together!

[Details at GCML](https://www.meetup.com/gem-city-tech/events/298375805/) 

The official GCML meeting will wrap up before DDL's usual end time,
so we can decide on the fly what we will do then - perhaps we'll go 
for dinner together, or stick around and try out what we just learned
together.

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 6:30 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
