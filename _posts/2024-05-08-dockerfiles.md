# May 2024: Dockerfiles

"Today we'll be doing a deep dive into crafting Dockerfiles for build speed, size, and security. How much time and space can we shave off? I'll be using a Python app with several dependencies as an example, talking about build philosophy related to Docker, and showing some concrete examples.  We'll also cover some related topics such as Docker Compose, Poetry dependency groups, and some ways to evolve a simple build process."

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
