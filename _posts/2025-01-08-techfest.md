# January 2025: TechFest preparations 

[Dayton TechFest](https://www.techfestdayton.org/) is coming up 
February 15-16, and DDL usually joins with [DLUG](https://linux.dma1.org/about-dlug/)
to present some cool open-source fun to the youth of Dayton.  For January,
let's continue our brainstorming on what to show off - and even work 
together on projects in progress.  I'll bring my own work on a project 
with OpenCV, a computer vision library - bring your own ideas if you've
got them!

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
