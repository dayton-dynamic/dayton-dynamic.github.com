# Topic: Programers' Jargon 

Parlez-vous programmese?  Like those in every field, programmers use a lot of jargon.  
It can be pretty intimidating when you don't know it.  Even when you do know the 
terms, unpacking them to look at exactly what they mean and how you'd explain them 
can be revelatory.

We're going to discuss and preview the jargon portion of a [PyOhio Tutorial](https://www.pyohio.org/2019/events/schedule/).
We'll also look at the webscraping and word-counting scripts used to suggest terms 
for the tutorial - it's (data) science!
