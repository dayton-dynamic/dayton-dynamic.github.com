# Topic: A Language from Scratch 

Marc Abel presents: A Language from Scratch

You may never need to write a programming language from the ground up - 
yet you can learn a ton from somebody who has.  For our November meeting, 
Marc Abel showed us the parser for DDL-Basic, a loving tribute to both 
TRS-80 BASIC and our group.  In December, he'll move on to the language 
implementation itself, showing how a language can be built from the ground 
up.  It's turtles (of code) all the way down.  You'll laugh, you'll learn,
you'll leave a bigger person.
