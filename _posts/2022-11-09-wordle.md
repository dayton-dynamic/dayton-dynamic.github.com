# November topic: Cheating at Worlde with Python 

Would you like to experience 
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)
as the pure intellectual exercise it was meant to be... or 
would you rather use your computer's power to take all the 
challenge out of it?

Us, too!  It turns out to be a fun programming puzzle that 
gives us a chance to review basic object-oriented Python 
as well as some more advanced topics, like

- The walrus operator `:=`
- Magic methods
- Match/case
- Enums
- Sets
- Deques
- Type annotations

We can branch out to discuss more instances of cheating, too, 
like the famous recent chess cheating scandal.

Let's also discuss... 

- PyDay 

## Innovation Hub - *not* Brixx!

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), a gorgeous new 
facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  Enter through 
the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
