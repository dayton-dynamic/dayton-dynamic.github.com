## Topic: JavaScript Game of Life (Part II) 

Happy New Year!

The majestic achievement that is our Game of Life implementation is almost ready to unleash 
upon the youth of Ohio via [TechFest 2021](http://www.techfestdayton.org/).  We'll review 
where we are, how it works, what we learned, and make last-minute decisions before launch. 

As usual, bring your grab bag of questions, thoughts, news, and 
projects in or about any language to throw in the soup.  We always have a good discussion.
