# January 2024: Managing your Google Account with Python 

Remember when you first got a Google account?  How that quota seemed 
ridiculously large, like you'd never fill it?  Ah, those were the days.

If you need a better way to figure out what's taking up all that space 
in your Google account, maybe Python can help.  We'll dig into some 
APIs and Python libraries and see if we can get that account under 
control. 

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
