# Topic: R

Alan Benson presents: R!

Why you do want to know about R if quality and costs are considerations when you write code?

Consider the following:

- The costs associated with data collection
- The average cost of data storage
- The average cost of a data breach
- The accuracy of results of your coding

Applications like R can be invaluable in not only being better with respect to administration, the quality of work can be improved as well. Let's meet and discuss how developing just a few skills in R can make you stand above and apart in the field of information technology.
