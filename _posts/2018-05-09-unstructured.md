# Unstructured discussion

Once upon a time, every DDL meeting was unstructured discussion.
This May, recall those old-fashioned days of democratically
free-flowing sharing.

Warning - this is likely to be a small meeting.  We have some regulars 
out of town.

Wed, May 9, 7 PM in the Dayton Chess Club.
