Regular expressions - or regexes - are a powerful, sophisticated cross-language technology 
for searching for patterns and extracting information from text.  
They've been a mainstay of all dynamic languages since advanced regular 
expressions were introduced to Perl in the 1980s.

Unfortunately, they also look like the squawks of an angry R2 unit.

So a newer technology, [Simple Regex Language](https://simple-regex.com/) 
(SRL), provides an 
alternate way to specify regexes - easier to write and easier to 
read, with all the same functionality under the covers.

We'll introduce ourselves to simplified regexes, and at the same time 
review the classic syntax.  Soon no text will be beyond your power to 
parse.

As always, we'll take some time for your general thoughts, questions, and ideas.
See you there!
