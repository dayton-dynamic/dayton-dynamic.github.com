It turns out there's much more to programming than, well,
programming.  Pros use an array of related techniques and 
tools to improve the quality of their process.  We'll 
review them so that you can start to use them, too... or 
improve your use if you already do. 

Topics include...

- Ticketing
- Version control
- Testing
- Linting
- Build servers

As always, we'll take some time for your general thoughts, questions, and ideas.  See you there!
