# Monty Python and the Holy Grail 

This is not actually a group meeting - just a fun community event we're getting involved in!

Dayton Dinner Theater is showing 
[Monty Python and the Holy Grail](https://www.daytondinnertheater.com/events/monty-python-and-the-holy-grail)

And, much like when the Victoria showed it last year (?), I'm going to take the opportunity to advertise DDL.  After all, what Monty Python fan wouldn't want to learn the programming language named after their favorite comedy troupe?

So if anybody would like to help out in chatting with folks about Python 
and/or our group, let the list know at dynamic-lang-sig@lists.dma1.org.  
We'll have some homemade Python-based Monty Python games for the attendees to play.  

Or if you'd just like to come for the movie and the dinner, that's great too!  Wave hello and give the games a try.  And let your friends know about it.

It takes place in the [Dayton Engineers Club](http://www.engineersclub.org/), 
which is worth seeing in its own right.
