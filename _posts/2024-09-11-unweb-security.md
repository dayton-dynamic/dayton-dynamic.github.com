# September 2024: Un-Web Security (+ Click)

## Un-Web Security 

If you're writing web applications, there is a LOT you need to learn 
about securing your code.

If you're not, then there are still code issues you should be aware 
of... just, fortunately, a lot fewer of them.  We'll go over the 
big ones - using Python for our examples (unsurprisingly), but many 
of them apply to other languages too.

We'll also leave a little time for a mini-topic...

## Click 

If a Python script that you invoke from the command line accepts 
user arguments, you might be using `sys.argv` or `argparse`, 
but there's a much nicer way: a popular and powerful library 
called `click`.  We'll take a quick look.

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
