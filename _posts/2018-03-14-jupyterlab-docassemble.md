Two topics for March:

1. JupyterLab! It's now been released in beta. We've been using Jupyter Notebooks a bunch to demo code, and JupyterLab is a whole coding environment that wraps around that.

2. DocAssemble - it's a tool for building websites to ask users a series of questions, then uses the responses in a variety of ways: to fill out a form, submit data to an API, send an email, etc. It's got an intriguing programming model, and spares you the work of building a front-end, yet still looks like a pro built it.
