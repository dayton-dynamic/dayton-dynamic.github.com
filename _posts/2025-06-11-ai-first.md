# June 2025: AI-first Engineering Culture

Special presentation this month by Matthew Alito!  

How do you build an AI-first engineering culture?  Touch points: Replit. The Phoenix Project, and The Experimentation Machine. 

Ever hear the old folk tale about John Henry and the Steam Engine? 
Well... it's time to root for the steam engine.  Who wants to die chiseling rock anyway?
