# January topic: Un-plain text apps

In the beginning, we interacted with computers through 
the command line.  It was simple, it was straightforward.
Now and then we spiced it up with a little ASCII art. 
But, when graphical desktops became common, and then 
web apps, plaintext was largely relegated to the back 
burner.

Here's the thing, though.  The simplicity of command-line 
applications never went away; and now plaintext is enjoying a 
renaissance with some new packages for building TUIs - Text 
User Interfaces.  These offer much of the snazzy functionality 
of GUIs and webapps, but combined with the simplicity and 
portability of text applications.  

Textual by [Textualize](https://www.textualize.io/) is one 
such package, now booming in the Python world.  We'll dive 
in and have some fun with it!

- Why I can't present on [Microsoft Playwright](https://playwright.dev) (yet?)

## Location: Innovation Hub 

We've begun to meet in the [Innovation Hub](https://www.thehubdayton.com/), 
a gorgeous new facility that's part of the renovated Dayton Arcade complex.  
Enter through the doors that face the Wright Stop Plaza bus hub.

Street parking is free in the evening.  I usually park on Ludlow Street.

*or* 

if for any reason coming downtown doesn't work for you (for instance, 
you've been exposed to COVID, or you've converted yourself to purely 
digital format and now exist as 
a set of cloud-hosted algorithms), we'll be online as well!  

Join us at 7 PM EDT on the PyFri Discord channel, [discord.gg/9SgTh3T](https://discord.gg/9SgTh3T), and click on the 
General voice chat link.  You may need to install the Discord desktop app rather than just using 
the web interface.
