# What did I learn?

Rummage sale 

## Chelink

![Chelnik the PostgreSQL elephant](chelnik.jpg)

You are Chelnik 

# [PyScript](https://pyscript.com/@examples/pandas/latest)

- Python in browser
- from Anaconda 
- introduced at PyCon 2022
- Rapidly maturing

::: {.notes}

- Python (no, really, real Python)... I feel bad for compile-to-JS
- The buzz goes on 
- Nobody's saying "this can't replace JavaScript anymore"

:::


## Uses 

- Manipulate DOM 
- See, edit, *and* execute Python

## Why?

- You hate JavaScript 
- Teaching tool
- Avoid installation issues  

::: {.notes}

Never really just JavaScript, there's the whole React stack
Cognitive load of other languages 

:::


## But can it?

- [Run sciencey stuff](https://pyscript.com/@examples/kmeans-in-panel/latest)?  YES!
- [Install arbitrary packages](https://pyscript.com/@examples/pyscript-jokes/latest)?  YES!
- [Access data from files](https://pyscript.com/@examples/antigravity/latest)?  YES!
- [load fast?](https://pyscript.net/tech-preview/micropython/about.html) `<script type="mpy">`
- [Download data](https://pyscript.com/@examples/pandas/latest)?  YES!

# LLMs 

Starry-eyed Messianic

Apocalyptic fear

grim jokes

## Simon Willison keynote

Realistic, cautious optimism 

Pragmatic advice

Imitation Intelligence

::: {.notes}

I thought he would talk about his Datasette work - would have skipped

:::

## RAG 

"Retrieval-Augmented Generation"

- Prime the conversational pump 
- Not re-training 

## Recording LLM use

- Use commit messages 
- Record prompts used! 

## Critical thinking 

- Ask for multiple answers
- Iterate conversationally 
- Explain the result 
- Ask for explanation

::: {.notes}

I never confer with Google about search results, I just try to think of a new search.  Must unlearn!

:::

## Hooray for errors 

Errors fire interest!

Will better LLMs be worse?  

::: {.notes}

Scientists and engineers love errors 

You need that attention that comes from skepticism 

Are we in the golden age?  When they get better, will they be worse?

:::

## [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/other-models.html) (package)

- Use from command line
- Store results in SQLite 

::: {.notes}

Can configure to custom destinations

# Design of Everyday APIs

Lynn Root

![Design of Everyday Things book cover](https://i5.walmartimages.com/seo/The-Design-of-Everyday-Things-Paperback-9780465050659_5919549e-bda3-4634-b303-5204d1cb7dd5.c89635bceb820affe0c3fd92e57268cb.jpeg?odnHeight=640&odnWidth=640&odnBg=FFFFFF) 

## API (broadly)

- Design == communication 

- Build on existing mental models

- Naming is hard --> bad design?

::: {.notes}

Walks through iteratively refining an API  

People may RTFM... after several attempts.  

Clever is bad

# DuckDB 

**Analytic** vs. OLTP 

Embedded like SQLite

::: {.notes}

Embedded - no process, no server

## Formats

- CSV, JSON

## Implementations 

- CLI
- Python (etc.) library
- PowerBI connector

## Dialect

# Data Open Space 

## ORM or no

    SELECT state.name,
            state.pop,
            city.name AS city,
            city.pop AS city_pop
    FROM   city 
    JOIN   state 
    ON     (city.state_id == state.id)

vs.

    city.name, city.pop, city.state.name, city.state.pop

## but 

- Extensive setup 
- Every ORM differs 
- Lose advanced SQL functionality
- Lose control over exact SQL 

## Query managers 

- [PugSQL](https://pugsql.org/)
- [DBXS](https://github.com/glyph/DBXS) by Glyph - adds structure to returned data - not just tuples 

::: {.notes}

Ground-level on DBXS - Glyph soliciting feedback

## Query builder

## Tuning 

- [pgmustard](https://www.pgmustard.com/) for postgresql tuning
- [dalibo](https://explain.dalibo.com/), visualize explain plans


## Data tool drawer 

- [VS Code Data Wrangler](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/data-wrangler) extension

- [SQLGlot](https://sqlglot.com/sqlglot.html) - "parser, transpiler, optimizer, and engine"
- [Ibis](https://ibis-project.org/) - "open source dataframe library that works with any data system" - what if RDBMS, but Pandas


# Logseq

- Markdown-based
- Quick crosslinks and tags
- Bullets/Paragraphs
- Query, don't organize
